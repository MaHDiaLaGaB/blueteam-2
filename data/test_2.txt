Those three days added an amazing 
confidant in me to really start and 
be more consistent and dispelling, 
like make roles for myself to not 
ruin things up with my capital, 
and this simple strategy i tried 
yesterday and made my first 20$ in 
Crypto yes today i am scared to trade, 
but i need to learn how to hold myself up.
